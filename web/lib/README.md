# `lib/` Directory

This folder is primarily used for [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components and related utilities.

- **Components**: Most of the reusable UI components generated or customized from shadcn/ui live here, under `components/`.
- **Utils**: Utility functions (such as class name helpers) used by these components are also placed here.

You generally shouldn't put application-specific logic in this folder.
